## How to configure clangd

When building a project: add `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1` to your cmake
flags. Medit will find the compile_commands.json file that clangd uses to 
figure out compilation flags. You could also use some other type of generator
like bear, that uses any build system and create the json file.

If you want to have more build flags to your project, a tip is to look up how
clangd uses `.clangd` files in the project directory for local settings, or 
`~/.config/clangd/config.yaml` for global settings.

Example of information to put in config.yaml:
```
CompileFlags:
  Add: [-I/usr/include/c++/11, -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/c++/11, -I/usr/include/c++/11/backward, -I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include, -I/usr/local/include, -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu, -I/usr/include]
```


Note that if you have multiplie compile_commands.json-files in your directory
Medit could pick the wrong one.



## Build with docker or podman

Install podman

```
sudo apt install podman
pip install podman-compose
```

build with 

```
